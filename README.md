# Shapeoko-Parts
These are parts I designed when I was setting up my Shapeoko 3 that have made life a lot easier. They are great first-step projects and are all made from MDF.

I have broken it down into the following categories:

* Work Holding (for holding work onto the Spoilboard/Wasteboard)
* Dust Management (for attaching vacuums and other things to the spindle)
* Enhancements (DXF, Solidworks, and other files for metal parts that extend the Shapeoko 3, these are not for the novice!!!)

ALL MATERIAL HERE IS DISTRIBUTED AS-IS-WHERE IS MOST OF THE FILES ARE IN FORMATS THAT CARBIDE MOTION AND CARBIDE CREATE WILL READ NATIVELY. THESE FILES WORKED FINE ON MY SYSTEMS BUT MAY NOT WORK WELL ON YOURS, IN FACT THEY MAY DESTROY YOUR MACHINE, CRASH YOUR HEAD, DAMAGE YOUR EGO AND IF NOT USED PROPERLY MAY HAVE CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING DEATH.

MACHINING IS AN INHERENTLY DANGEROUS PROCESS INVOLVING HIGH VOLTAGES, LARGE CURRENTS, AS WELL AS CUTTING DEVICES THAT LAUGH AT THE SOFTNESS OF HUMAN FLESH AND MAY RESULT IN FIRE, BREATHING INJURY, ETC. 

I HAVE PROVIDED THESE FILES AS A STARTING POINT, RUN THEM FIRST WITHOUT THE ROUTER IN PLACE TO BE SURE THE HEAD DOESN'T CRASH.

IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING, KILL SOMEONE (INCLUDING YOURSELF), BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN OR IN SOME WAY DAMAGE PROPERTY OR VIOLATE THE LAW THAT'S ON YOU. THE USE OF THESE FILES IS SO FAR OUTSIDE MY CONTROL I CANNOT EXTEND ANY WARRANTY OR LIABILITY. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!
